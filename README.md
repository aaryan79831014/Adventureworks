Adventureworks
==============

My Take on AdventureWorks with different frameworks and patterns

The database is downloaded from http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/93587
I have choosen the 2008 R2 version, don't ask me why, i do not have an answer, some may suggest why not express edition.
I am just interested in learning the framework stuffs, so didn't bother much about thewhat i use.
Infact i have developed most of the implementation of code in visual studio express edition.
